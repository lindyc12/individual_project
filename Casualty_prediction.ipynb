    "The goal of this project is the investigate casualty class (Driver or Rider, Pedestrian or Passenger) in accidents in hopes of implementing more safety measures for these classes. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20 with sensitive information already removed. It has 33 features and 12316 instances of an accident. It also includes weather conditions, type of vehicles, number of casualties and information about them, there are a lot of features in this dataset for analysis. I hope to show casualty traits through visualizations and create an algorithm that can predict the severity of accidents. \n",

    "- Does lighting affect class of casualty?\n",
    "- Does gender affect severity?\n",
    "- What are the age group are most likely to be involved in accidents?\n",
    "- What are the areas with higher accident severity or lower accident severity?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be answering few of the questions as I mentioned above. We will also figure out some way to implement the machine learning on this dataset and see what we can come up with."
